            Hi! I'm David Sandoval, a passionate web developer and data
            analyst with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and
            modern software engineering practices. Outside of coding, I enjoy
            exploring City Pop music, practicing calisthenics, and diving into
            new programming challenges!

                I began my journey in computer science when I discovered PSeint.
                I was fascinated by everything I could create with this tool,
                which eventually led me to Python, the first programming language
                I learned, and I was truly amazed. This experience inspired me to
                pursue the degree I am currently studying. As I progressed, I
                discovered my true passion: Software Design, Development, and
                Artificial Intelligence.

                In 2023, I began studying Computer Science Engineering at Escuela
                Superior PolitÃ©cnica del Litoral (ESPOL). At the end of my first
                semester, I participated in PyWeekend, a university-organized
                hackathon for Programming Fundamentals students.

              By mid-2024, I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Assistant 
              for the Software Design course, one of the many subjects that have 
              fascinated me due to its blend of creativity and logical problem-solving. 
              In this role, I refined my understanding of object-oriented principles, 
              software architecture, and design patterns. I also developed a passion 
              for mentoring students, helping them break down complex concepts into 
              actionable steps, and fostering an environment of collaborative learning.
              </p>
              <p className="section-paragraph">
              Later that year, I embarked on a project to join the 
              Club de Inteligencia Artificial PolitÃ©cnico (CIAP) under the mentorship 
              of Kevin Santana. Thanks to his excellent guidance, my teammate 
              JosÃ© Toapanta and I earned the Best Aspiring Team award.
